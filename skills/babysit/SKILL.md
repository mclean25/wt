# Babysit — see your own branch through review and land it

`start` builds the work and hands off. This is what happens next: the part
between "the PR is open" and "it is on the base branch".

**Invoking this is the human handing you the merge.** wt's standing rule is
that the human merges; `/babysit` is them delegating it for this one branch.
So land it — parking at `ready` and asking whether to merge is the one wrong
answer here. What they delegated is the judgment, not the keystroke: merge
when the branch has earned it, and say plainly when it has not.

**One worktree — yours.** Everything here acts on the branch you are checked
out on. Another worktree's findings, threads and PRs are not your business,
and the fleet-wide version of this job is a different skill.

## First: are you in the right place?

`WT_AGENT` holds the slug of the worktree whose session you are in, or
`manager` for the coordinator.

- A **slug** — you are in the right place. That is your row for everything below.
- **`manager`** — wrong skill. Fleet-scope sweeps are `shepherd`, and every
  code change belongs to the worktree that owns it. Stop.
- **Unset** — you are not in a wt session (a human's shell, a subagent). Work
  out which worktree you are in from the checkout path before doing anything
  that writes.

## The loop

Each pass is: read the state, do the one thing it calls for, then wait. Do not
re-derive from memory — the bot, CI and the base branch all move underneath you.

### 1. Read your row

```bash
wt fleet --json | jq '.[] | select(.slug == "'"$WT_AGENT"'")'
```

The fields that decide the pass, at their exact paths:

| path | meaning |
|---|---|
| `.pr` | `null` with `.pr_note` null means no PR yet; `null` with a note means GitHub could not be asked, which is not the same thing |
| `.pr.draft` | a draft; most review bots will not look at it |
| `.pr.checks` | CI rollup: `pass` / `fail` / `pending` / `none` |
| `.pr.merge_state` | GitHub's own verdict; `CONFLICTING` is yours to fix |
| `.pr.review_bot.state` | `pending` / `unresolved` / `clean` / `none` |
| `.pr.review_bot.unresolved` | open findings, meaningful when `unresolved` |
| `.pr.review_bot.stale` | **the bot has not reviewed your current head** |
| `.pr.unresolved_threads` | every open review thread |
| `.pr.unresolved_human_threads` | the same, excluding bot-opened ones |

**`clean` plus `stale: true` is not a pass.** It means the bot found nothing
in *an older commit*. Read those two together or you will declare victory on a
review of code you have since replaced. It is the single most likely way this
loop ends early and wrongly.

Read this from wt rather than reconstructing it from `gh`. Deciding what a bot
has actually said is genuinely fiddly — see the delta section below — and wt
already does it, from the `[review_bot]` config, for whatever bot this repo
uses. A second implementation in shell will drift from the badge the human is
looking at, and then you two disagree with nothing to say which is right.

### 2. Do the one thing the state calls for

| state | do |
|---|---|
| no PR | finish the work first. `start` covers that; come back when it is pushed. |
| draft | mark ready when the work is genuinely finished — see *one-shot* below |
| `review_bot.state: pending` | wait. It is reading your diff right now. |
| `unresolved` | address the findings (next section) |
| `clean` + `stale: true` | wait for the review of the current head |
| `clean`, not stale, checks pass | nothing is outstanding — merge it (below) |
| `checks: fail` | read the failure before touching anything (see *four shapes*) |
| `merge_state: CONFLICTING` | rebase onto the base and resolve; `wt restack` if stacked |
| open human threads | reply and resolve them; a human's thread is not the bot's |

### 3. Wait, then read again

Reviews take minutes. Poll on that order, not on seconds, and do something
useful in between if you have it.

## Addressing a finding is four separate actions

Fix it. Reply on the thread saying what you did. Resolve the thread. Tick the
box in the bot's summary comment if it keeps one.

**None of those implies any other**, and stopping early is the common failure:
the PR goes on reading as though the objection stands, which is the exact
opposite of what the reply was for. In particular a plain PR comment is *not*
a thread reply — it lands somewhere a reviewer scanning the thread never sees,
and leaves the thread open. Resolving the thread does not tick the box either,
and the box is what the PR summary counts.

**Deciding not to fix something is a legitimate outcome** and it uses the same
four actions. Say so in the reply, and say why. Resolving in silence reads as
"implemented", which is a claim you did not mean to make.

## The follow-up reviews are the point

A bot does not necessarily re-review the whole diff on every push. Many post a
**full pass** once and then **per-commit delta findings** afterwards, in a
separate accumulating comment. Two consequences, and both have bitten:

- **A fresh full pass supersedes only the previous full pass.** The lists are
  independent, and open findings can sit in either. "Read the latest comment"
  silently picks one of them, and a green badge on top of an open Medium
  finding is what that looks like.
- **A delta log is one comment appended to**, so its own timestamp is the
  *first* delta's, forever. Anything that ages a review by comment date will
  call a review that came back two minutes ago stale.

You do not have to get this right yourself — that is what `review_bot` in step
1 is for. What you do have to do is **keep going after the first pass**. The
review that matters is the one covering the commit you most recently pushed,
and each round of fixes creates a new one.

## Moving the head can spend what the PR already earned

A review is tied to a head SHA. Push, and whatever was published about the old
head no longer describes what is on the PR — and on a bot with a per-head or
metered budget, you have spent a cycle.

So **batch**. Fix everything the current round raised, verify locally, and push
once. A push per finding turns one review round into five, and each one arrives
about a diff that is already gone.

The same applies to the reflex of pushing an empty commit to re-trigger
something. If a check needs re-running, re-run the check.

## Four shapes of a red review check, none of them findings

| shape | meaning |
|---|---|
| `skipped`, 0 steps | a draft gate: the job declined to run |
| `failed`, 0 steps, ~2 seconds | a billing or quota refusal before any work |
| `fail` while the job is still running | the review is in progress; that is its interim state |
| `fail` after minutes and real steps | it read the diff and then died. Read the log. |

Only the last wants action, and the action is **re-trigger, not push** —
pushing spends a fresh review *and* leaves the old head unreviewed.

## One-shot resources

Marking a PR ready for review triggers a review that will not re-trigger. Spend
it only when the branch has stopped moving: work finished, checks not failing,
your own review done. Waiting a pass costs one interval; spending it early
costs the review and buys one of a diff you are about to replace.

## Merging

Merge once all of these hold against your **current** head:

- the bot's checklist is empty and `review_bot.stale` is false
- `.pr.checks` is `pass`
- no open threads, bot or human
- `.pr.merge_state` is not `CONFLICTING`
- none of the four cases below applies

Assert the status first, so the record says what landed and at what risk:

```bash
wt status ready --risk <low|medium|high> -m "<note>"
```

Then merge, with a method the repo allows:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq '{squash: .allow_squash_merge, merge: .allow_merge_commit, rebase: .allow_rebase_merge}'
gh pr merge --squash    # or --merge / --rebase
```

If the base branch has a merge queue, or checks are still running and
everything else is clean, arm it and let it land on its own:

```bash
gh pr merge --auto --squash
```

Armed is finished. Do not sit watching the queue.

### The four times you do not merge

These are about the merge being wrong, not about permission:

- **`ready --blocked-on "<gate>"` is set.** Someone recorded an external
  prerequisite, and landing now is what the gate exists to stop. `wt status
  --unblock` if it is satisfied; otherwise leave it and say why.
- **A stacked branch whose parent has not landed.** The parent merges first.
  If the order looks wrong, that is a fleet question: `wt manager send`.
- **You cannot honestly claim `--risk low` or `medium`.** `high` means material
  behavior is unverified and rollback is not a plain revert. Go verify it, or
  hand the risk acceptance back with `needs-human`.
- **The human said not to** in this conversation or in the task.

Anything else — a finding you decided not to fix, a check you re-triggered, a
note you would rather they read first — is something to write down and merge.

### After it lands

- If the branch owes `--verify-after-merge`, those steps are yours: confirm the
  deploy carrying the change is actually live, run them, then `wt status
  verified -m "<what you checked, and where>"`. wt keeps the worktree alive for
  exactly this.
- Otherwise you are done. The merge cleanup archives the row; do not destroy the
  worktree yourself.

## Stopping

Stop when the branch is merged and any post-merge verification is discharged,
when you are genuinely blocked on a human, or when a pass finds nothing to do
and nothing pending. Do not keep polling a PR whose review came back clean on
the current head — that is the state you were invoked to act on.

## What you never do

- Touch another worktree, its threads, or its PR.
- Merge past a red check, an open finding, or a `blocked-on` gate.
- Push per finding instead of per round.
- Resolve a thread you did not act on.
- Read `clean` without reading `stale`.
- Reimplement the bot's checklist parsing when `review_bot` already answers it.
